# Bark Board

---

## Bark Board is a social media platform for pets and their owners.

**Bark Board** was created as a message board style social media platform where users can come together to ask questions, share information, and generally speak about their pets and experiences as pet owners. Users first create an account and then can create posts on which a discussion can be held in the comments section. The comment section is styled as a thread tied to the post, so that users can have a contained conversation. Posts can be edited and deleted by the post owner. An extra bit of moderation power is given to users as they may delete any comment made in the thread.
